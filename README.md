# TextDataProcessor
#
# If you are on a Windows machine, please create a new folder in the C drive called TextFilesInput.
# Then place text files in this folder
#
# Alternatively, you can modify the textFilesLocation variable in textFilesProvider.py (from "C:\\TextFilesInput") to the location of the text files.
#
# Run main.py to analyze the text files.
#
# NLTK:
# This application is dependant on the NLTK library. Some parts of the NLTK may need to be downloaded for it to run so lines 2-3 in wordValidator.py and lines 4-5 in texxtParser.py may need to be uncommented on the first run of th application.
